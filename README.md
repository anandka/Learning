			suchas: 1. Gives good visualization/ Dashboard.
				2. Makes piplines as first class citizen of jenkins.
				3. Good view of pipline and direct as well as prettier view of logs.
				4. Entire Jenkins can be driven through code which is good less lot less configuration.
				5. You can directly run build steps in docker. This means less pre-configuration of Jenkins host required.

(Example : Formatting the title across many slides, Formatting the text boxes on the same slide etc)
			- Similarly if there is a shape you want to use multiple times. (Example: Connector to connect various shapes on your slide) You can right-click on the shpae (in our example connector) and select "lock drawing mode" once you do that you can use the selected shape as many times as you want. To get out of the drawing mode just hit "Esc"
			- Copy paste element multiple times with same gap between them (Use Ctrl + D)

		2. Its no magic but all internal OS/Kernel level things 
		3. Why CGroups is important 
		      -- I never gave lot of importance to this before but after seeing the video I realised that how host machine and containers are soo much linked . One wrong container can be really harmful  (somewhere around 33 min this section starts ) 
		4.  How Pid's , namespaces, mounts are shared and blocked from host and container
